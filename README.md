<h1>Banking System - C++ Project</h1>

<h1>🚀 Overview</h1>

This Banking System is a console-based application developed in C++ with a focus on Functional Programming (FP). It provides essential banking functionalities, secure user authentication, and advanced user management with permission control.

<h1>📌 Features</h1>

🔹 Core Banking Operations

Find Client

Add Client (with duplicate account/user validation)

Delete Client

Update Client Information

Print All Clients

Deposit & Withdraw

View Total Balances

🔹 Secure Authentication & User Management

Login & Logout System integrated into the Main Menu

User Management Module:

List Users

Add Users

Delete Users

Update Users

Find Users

Assign custom access permissions (e.g., restrict deletion access)

Users without permission are prompted to contact an admin

🔹 Functional Programming (FP) Implementation

Pure functions for improved maintainability and efficiency

Minimized side effects for increased reliability

Higher-order functions for user role and permission management

Modular design for scalability
